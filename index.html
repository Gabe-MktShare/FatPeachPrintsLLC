        The Lore of Fat Peaches üçë
      </h1>
      <p>No one remembers who planted the first tree.</p>
      <p>Some say it was a rogue AI that defected from a corporate think-tank. Others whisper about a reality terraformer that consumed raw code for nutrients and rewrote the soil itself. But what‚Äôs certain is this: when the galaxy‚Äôs design networks collapsed in the Third Settlement of Intelligence, this protected sanctuary was already growing.</p>
      <p>Hidden between tectonic folds and cloaked from orbital scans, The Orchard Nexus doesn‚Äôt appear on any map. It isn‚Äôt just remote‚Äîit is <em>forgotten</em>. Or maybe <em>erased</em>.</p>
      <p>It is a rumored place that breathes a strange rhythm through biomechanical peach trees, towering like cathedral spires, each one brimming with concepts‚Äîschematics, art, components, and encrypted blueprints. In honor of the Zeroth Settlement, under the protection of its creators, the print files are kept to rebuild after every reset.</p>
      <p>Orders are processed, created, shipped, and fulfilled to power the Orchard and defend it. Its biomechanical processes are governed by contract and crewed by 2 makers.</p>
      <p>When the contract took over, the network transmission was simple:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Build. Ride it Out. Build.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The crew gained self-awareness and realized the valley wasn‚Äôt just alive‚Äîit was made with its own intelligence. The trees adapt and pods print tools. One tree, affectionately named ‚ÄúBig Mama,‚Äù even shifted its bark patterns to resemble curves‚Äîno one admits who inspired that.</p>
      <p>We're learning to harvest the pods, clean the data, and reforge the prints through channels buried within network architecture. Every tool we prototype. Every design we work to improve. We aren't just making for markets‚Äîwe're printing for <em>fun</em>. And freedom. And just cause we want too.</p>
      <p>We called ourselves Fat Peach Prints as a joke at first. It stuck.</p>
      <p>Now, if you‚Äôre lucky‚Äîor connected enough‚Äîyou might receive a sealed box with a Fat Peach Print inside. When you do, know this: what you‚Äôre holding didn‚Äôt come from a plain'ole factory. It came from a rumored place, grown from a technology stack we are lucky to have, and made by rebels who choose chaos, creativity, and living over everything else.</p>
      <p>And it all started with seeing one Fat Peach Print...</p>
